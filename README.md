### Microframework
Small, modulable microframework. With minimal features to enable highly optimized webpages. Highly experimental. Not recommended for a production.

## Currently alpha stage (based on my profile)
* Simplicity is a key (a framework which developer has no idea what is doing is not worth using)
* PHP will be outdated by 2020 if it wouldn't receive static types and more people to a community

## Features (todo)
* Simple router with parameters, `$_GET` & `$_POST` handling
* MVC enabled maybe other design patterns.
* Preload frontend friendly
* Plugins friendly

##Why?
Other framework didn't satisfy my simple mind. I had no idea what was I coding after 30 minutes of spent time.
I was actually learning Symfony for work. It's quite nice but too hard for me. I am not a new developer but not an experienced one.

##Rules
* PSR-1, PSR-2 (except the 4 space. I am using tabs. Will probably embrace), PSR-4 (autoloading)
* `declare(strict_types=1);` and usage of type hinting
* Write documentation for every method and class (if it's not self explanatory)
* We are in experimental development. Any idea around technologies and architecture is welcome.
* Keep things simple. Features should be elegant and simple.
e.g. Login and Registration should be made by a plugin so it can have it's developers.
* Featured plugins should follow this rules but don't need to.

##Joining development
Absolutely you can join. If this framework will reach a good state it will receive separate github profile and a team
If you want to feature a plugin just pull a request :) (Experimental dev only features can vary in a future)
